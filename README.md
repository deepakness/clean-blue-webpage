This is a clean and minimal single-page webpage template created using plain HTML and CSS. The template can be used for a simple one-page portfolio website or for anything of that matter (an announcement page, a coming soon page, etc.).

Here's how it looks [when hosted](https://deepakness.github.io/clean-blue-webpage/):
